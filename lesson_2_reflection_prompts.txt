What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    it makes the folder able make commits

commands:
    git init: makes folder able to produce commits (creates repository)
    git add: add files to the "staging area" so they are ready to be commited
    git status: gives the status of the working directory (the folder) and the staging area
    git commit: creates comit for files in staging area

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    working directory shows files normally (no commits), repository:
    staging area: files which is ready to be commited (git commit)
