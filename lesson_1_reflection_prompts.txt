How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?


    git log show versions of saved files (latest is displayed in the top)
    git diff id_1 id_2 compares to files saved in different times

    git checkout id, goes back in time and check out script

    git checkout id, goes back in time and check out script
